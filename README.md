# Russian Flashcards
A simply python project to study Russian vocabulary

This project uses two vocabulary files to create arrays of vocabulary words in English and Russian, and uses a GUI library to create a graphical interface. It was intended to be a Python version of the JavaScript/HTML 'Russian Study Helper', but still needs the grammar tables added.
